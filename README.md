# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A JavaScript SaaS based Rock Paper Scissor game.

A simple Rock Paper Scissor game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is part of my JavaScript learning journey. Special thanks to Apna College for their free lectures and MDN for their extensive documentation. This game showcases basic game logic and dynamic updates.
 
 The objective is to develop a stylish, responsive and functional Rock Paper Scissor game between the User and the Computer by generating a random choice from the computerâ€™s side, comparing both the choices and updating the scores respectively.
